# Customer Satisfaction Prediction - Airline Service
This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction levels for an airline service based on various factors, including service quality, in-flight experience, and customer interactions.

The model not only predicts satisfaction but also provides insights into key areas where improvements can enhance passenger experience. Businesses can leverage this project to refine their services and align them with customer expectations.
